## 🕹️ Task 02 - Number Guessing Game 🎯🔢 (SCT_SD_2)

This is **Task 2** of my Software Development Internship at **SkillCraft Technology**.


### 👩‍💻 Task Details  
Created a **Python GUI-based game** where users try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The application provides real-time feedback on each guess and informs the user whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct. This task focuses on GUI programming, logic building, and user interaction.


### 🚀 Features  
✅ Random number generation  
✅ User input through a graphical interface  
✅ Real-time feedback messages  
✅ Reset option for a new game  
✅ Error handling for invalid inputs  


### 🧠 Concepts Used  
- `Tkinter` for GUI  
- `random` module for number generation  
- Event-driven programming  
- Exception handling  
- Input validation and UI interaction


### 📁 File  
`NumberGuessing.py` — Main Python script with GUI implementation


### 📌 Output Example  
A pop-up-based graphical game window with:  
🎮 Instruction label  
🔢 Input field to enter guesses  
🖱️ Button to submit the guess  
📊 Live feedback and messagebox when guessed correctly

### ▶ Demo  
A short video demonstrating the working of the game is available.
